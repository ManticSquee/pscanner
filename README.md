# pscanner
Basic port scanner

Goal: The goal of thie project was to design a simple python script to find open ports on a given host.

The expected outcome if that a user can input a specific IP address and identify which ports are open.  To avoid excessive print, only open ports will be displayed.
A small range of ports will scan fairly quickly compared to a larger range.  The range can easily be modified to suit your needs.
